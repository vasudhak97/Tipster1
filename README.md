## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes
I was initially unaware that navigation controllers were required to go back and forth from views, so it took me extra 
long to get that running. 

I also changed a file name and that caused the program to crash, which I didn't figure out till later.

I also had added a gesture and conencted it to a method that I then deleted. I did not however delete the gesture from 
storyboard and that caused issues.
